"""The /app/recon_settings bind of a real spawn.

The recon settings registry decides every parameter's bound and every rate's
engagement ceiling, and the loader refuses to start a scan without it. So it is
baked into the scan images, and this bind overlays the host's fresher copy so a
registry edit takes effect without a rebuild.

That makes its failure modes deliberately different from graph_db's, and the
difference is the point of these tests:

  graph_db         a wrong guess binds an empty auto-created dir OVER the baked
                   copy, and the scan dies on an import error
  recon_settings   no guess is ever made. Binding nothing costs freshness and
                   never correctness, because the baked copy is still there.

Driven through the ACTUAL spawn path with a stubbed docker client, so it fails
if the helper is right but a spawn site stops calling it.

Run:  docker exec redamon-recon-orchestrator sh -c 'cd /app && python -m pytest tests/test_spawn_recon_settings_bind.py -v'
