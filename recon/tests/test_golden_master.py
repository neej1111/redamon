T17: the resolved-settings golden master.

This is the test that decides whether the registry refactor is safe, and it is
worth more than the file-level drift tests combined.

Comparing generated FILES catches almost nothing: a generator can emit a
plausible `settings['X'] = project.get('y', D)` that is byte-different from the
original in a way no diff flags, and every risk in this work shows up only in
the VALUE a scan ends up running with. So this compares behaviour.

It is a gate on every phase, not a milestone. A red run here stops that phase
rather than being triaged afterwards, because a red run means some project's
scan is now configured differently and nobody asked for it.

When a change here IS intended, regenerate with
`python3 recon/tests/regen_golden_settings.py` and read the diff. Every line of
it is a value some scan will run with.

Run: python -m pytest recon/tests/test_golden_master.py -v
