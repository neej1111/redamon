 *
 * `blurb` is doing two jobs, so the fields are split by AUDIENCE:
 *
 *  - `blurb` is the shared, table-safe text. It becomes ONE MARKDOWN TABLE CELL
 *    in the generated API reference, so it stays to a sentence or two. Changing
 *    it changes `redamon.wiki/MCP-API-Reference.md`, which means `npm run
 *    docs:mcp` has to run in the same change or apiReference.test.ts goes red.
 *  - `access`, `detail` and `learnMore` are UI-only. The renderer never prints
 *    them, so adding or editing any of them needs no regeneration.
