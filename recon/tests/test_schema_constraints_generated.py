"""`graph_db/schema.py` builds its constraints from the label-key declaration.

Before this, a node label was declared twice: once as a `CREATE CONSTRAINT`
string in schema.py, and once as prose in the text-to-cypher prompt. Adding a
label meant editing both, and forgetting either failed silently - no error, just
a label the agent could never query, or a MERGE with no uniqueness guarantee
behind it.

Now `graph_db/schema_keys.py` is the single declaration and schema.py renders
its statements from it. This file pins the two things that makes safe:

1. The generated statements are BYTE-IDENTICAL to the 45 originals. The
   constraint name is part of the identity - a same-name `CREATE ... IF NOT
   EXISTS` against a database still holding the old constraint is a silent
   no-op - so a reworded statement is a schema migration, not a refactor.

2. Every tenant-scoped key still ends in user_id + project_id. That tuple is the
   tenant isolation boundary, not a convention: dropping it from a key would let
   two projects collide on one node.
