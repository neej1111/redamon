/**
 * The read-side classification for `Project`.
 *
 * The posture CHANGED with the recon settings registry, deliberately and in two
 * directions at once, so this file is worth reading rather than skimming.
 *
 * It used to be a positive set: a new column was unreadable until someone
 * classified it, and the whole Rules of Engagement block was withheld. That
 * second half does not survive contact with the goal. An agent holding an MCP
 * token has to stand up a project that provably cannot violate its scope, and
 * an agent that cannot see its own rate ceiling, its own excluded hosts or its
 * own forbidden tools cannot verify that it is inside them. Withholding the
 * ceiling does not make the ceiling safer; it makes it unverifiable.
 *
 * So the set inverts: `readable: false` is explicit per column in
 * `recon_settings/registry.yaml` and everything else is readable. The thing
 * that has to hold is that the NAMED set never shrinks by accident, which is
 * what the tests below are, and they name each withheld column rather than
 * relying on a pattern.
 *
 * What stays withheld is what an agent has no business with whatever its
 * permissions: a stored credential, third-party personal data, and the signed
 * engagement document itself.
