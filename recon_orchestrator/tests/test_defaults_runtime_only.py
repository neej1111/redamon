"""
Surface 11: `/defaults` excludes exactly what is not a project default.

The endpoint turns `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` into the camelCase blob a new project form
seeds itself from and a preset apply resets against. Anything in it that is NOT
a Project column is a key the form will try to write back, and the save fails
with a Prisma "Unknown argument" error.

The ProjectForm carries a workaround for exactly that, in a comment naming
`takeoverCnameValidationEnabled`: it only touches keys already present in the
form. That workaround is downstream of the bug. Deriving the exclusion list from
the registry removes the bug, because `source: internal` IS the set of keys with
no column.

The hand-written list had drifted in both directions: it named `FOFA_EMAIL`,
which no longer exists anywhere, and it missed two credential keys and seven
column-less settings.
