# RedAmon as an MCP Server (inbound)

RedAmon can expose itself to **external AI agents** over the Model Context
Protocol. A customer's own agent, an MCP-capable client, or a scripted pipeline
connects in, authenticates as **one RedAmon user**, and can do three things
scoped to that user's own projects: start a full recon pipeline, change a narrow
set of recon tuning settings, and query the attack-surface graph.

> **Two MCP features, opposite directions.** Do not confuse them.
>
> | | Direction | Where |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | **MCP Tool Plugins** ([README.MCP.md](README.MCP.md)) | **outbound** — RedAmon is the *client* of servers you register | Global Settings → *MCP Tool Plugins* |
> | **MCP Server** (this document) | **inbound** — other agents are the *clients*, RedAmon is the *server* | Global Settings → *MCP Server* |

## 1. What is and is not exposed

**Exposed (thirty tools).**

| Tool | What it does | Permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_projects` | The token owner's projects. Nothing else is visible. | `recon:read` |
| `get_recon_status` | Whether a scan is running, and its phase. | `recon:read` |
| `get_recon_settings` | The tuning subset this token may change. | `recon:read` |
| `graph_summary` | Count per node type + relationships present. | `recon:read` |
| `graph_schema` | What the graph *means*. No arguments, no data. | `recon:read` |
| `query_graph` | Ask the graph a question in natural language. | `recon:read` (+ `graph:cypher` for raw Cypher) |
| `kali_toolbox` | The Kali sandbox's installed toolset, by category. Reads code, not the container. | `recon:read` |
| `start_recon` | Start the full recon pipeline. | `recon:scan` (+ `recon:overwrite` for `mode:"overwrite"`) |
| `stop_recon` | Stop a running scan. | `recon:scan` |
| `update_recon_settings` | Change any recon tuning value. Validated and capped at scan start rather than blocked. | `recon:settings` |
| `create_project` | Open an engagement and fix its scope, atomically with the record of what authorized it. | `project:create` |
| `attach_engagement_authorization` | Record the scope document that permits this engagement. Append-only. | `engagement:authorize` |
| `list_engagement_authorizations` | The history of what authorized it, newest first. | `recon:read` |
| `preflight_scope_check` | Read-only proof that the configured pipeline fits the scope. RESOLVED values, not written ones. | `recon:read` |
| `kali_exec` | A shell in the sandbox: `bash -c`, full toolset, **no target check**. | `kali:exec` |
| `kali_output` | That command's output, paged from a byte cursor. | `kali:exec` |
| `kali_cancel` | Stop a command it started. | `kali:exec` |
| `list_findings` | Every finding, ranked when a triage run has produced a ranking and honest about it when not. | `recon:read` |
| `list_muted_findings` | The findings a person suppressed. Hidden from every other tool here. | `triage:read` |
| `list_remediations` | What to fix, with CVSS, CVE/CWE/CAPEC, exploit and KEV flags. | `triage:read` |
| `get_project_activity` | Every scan in flight on this project, plus whether a start would be refused. | `recon:read` |
| `list_scan_versions` | Saved graph versions, with `pinned` and `hasSnapshot`. | `recon:read` |
| `compare_scan_versions` | What changed between two graph states. Counts and names only. | `recon:read` |
| `describe_recon_settings` | The reference manual for `update_recon_settings`: meanings, types, bounds. | `recon:read` |
| `list_recon_presets` | The curated engagement presets, and how much of each is applicable here. | `recon:read` |
| `get_attack_surface_overview` | Hosts, services, web surface and findings by severity, in one query. | `recon:read` |
| `list_exploit_paths` | Technology + CVE pairs ranked by observed exploit, then CVSS. | `recon:read` |
| `get_blast_radius` | Technologies ranked by how much of the surface they touch. | `recon:read` |
| `list_graph_views` | Saved graph views, by name. Never their query text. | `recon:read` |
| `run_graph_view` | Run a saved view through the same guards as raw Cypher. | `recon:read` + `graph:cypher` |
| `queue_recon` | Queue a full recon for when the host has room. | `recon:queue` |
| `cancel_queued_scan` | Cancel a queued job, reading the update count so a lost race is not reported as success. | `recon:queue` |
| `get_scan_status` | The other six scanners' state, masked exactly as `get_recon_status` is. | `recon:read` |
| `set_finding_verdict` | Record a durable triage verdict. Refused while a triage run could re-file it. | `triage:write` |

**Deliberately not exposed:** the agent chat, a shell, partial recon, project
create/delete/import, secrets and LLM keys, target and scope fields, Rules of
Engagement, guardrails, **starting** a GVM / TruffleHog / supply-chain / AI
attack-surface scan, captured HTTP traffic, version activation or deletion, and
any graph **write**.

Note the distinction the reads above draw: their FINDINGS are readable (a
finding is a finding whichever scanner wrote it), while **starting** those scans
is not. Muting and unmuting are not exposed either, in either direction: mute is
the one action that makes a finding invisible to every other read here, and
unmute reverses a human's suppression decision, which is exactly the power the
architecture withholds from the model-driven path.

`kali_toolbox` serves the `kali_shell` `TOOL_REGISTRY` description verbatim -
the same bytes the in-app agent is prompted with. One source, no second copy: a
transcription would drift from the image the moment a tool is added, and a
catalogue that lies about what is installed is worse than none. All of it is
runnable, because `kali_exec` is a shell.

One correction is appended, and it is not a fork of the catalogue. The catalogue
is written FOR the in-app agent, which has dedicated tools (`execute_nmap`,
`execute_nuclei`, `execute_curl`) alongside `kali_shell`, so it ends by telling
the reader NOT to use the shell for those. An MCP caller has no dedicated tools:
`kali_exec` is the only way it runs anything, so read literally that line tells
it not to use the one tool it has. A short `NOTE FOR MCP CALLERS` after the
catalogue says so, and names the tools the advice steered it away from.

Served by the agent's `GET /kali/toolbox` (`require_master_internal_auth`). It
never calls the kali-sandbox, holds no `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, and takes no
`projectId`, so it answers even when the sandbox is down.

### 1.1 `kali_exec` IS `kali_shell`

**This is a shell, by decision.** `kali_exec` hands the command verbatim to
`kali_shell`, which is `subprocess.run(["bash", "-c", command])` on a container
with `NET_ADMIN`, `NET_RAW`, `seccomp:unconfined` and open egress. Pipelines,
redirection, substitution, loops and every installed binary all work. There is
no allowlist, no per-flag check and **no per-command target check**.

That is deliberate parity with the in-app agent, and the reasoning is worth
recording because an earlier version of this file argued the opposite at length.

**The in-app agent has no per-command admission either.** Its gates are a HUMAN
clicking the `DANGEROUS_TOOLS` confirmation (`REQUIRE_TOOL_CONFIRMATION`,
default on), an RoE check that matches tool NAMES and never reads a command
string, and a scope guardrail that runs once per session. None of those inspects
`kali_shell "nmap victim.tld"`. So a guard on the MCP path was not restoring
parity with the drawer - it was holding the MCP path to a standard the drawer
was never held to.

**What carries the weight instead is reachability.** Three independent switches,
each owned by a different decision-maker, and all three must be on:

| # | Switch | Who sets it | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `MCP_KALI_EXEC_ENABLED` | operator, per deployment | **off** |
| 2 | the `kali:exec` scope | user, password-confirmed at mint | **off** |
| 3 | `project.mcpKaliExecEnabled` | a human in the project form | **off** |

Switch 3 is `mcp: never` in the settings registry with the reason `escalation`,
so `update_recon_settings` cannot turn it on: a token can never grant itself
this. A token holding all three has a root shell in the sandbox,
and that is the intended contract.

**What this costs, stated plainly.** There is no server-side restraint on where a
command points. An agent granted `kali:exec` can reach any host the sandbox can,
including one this project is not for. The product's scope boundary is enforced
for `update_recon_settings` (§6) and for the recon pipeline; on this path it is
not enforced at all, and the surface says so in three places the agent actually
reads: the `kali_exec` tool description, the `kali:exec` consent copy, and the
Agent Onboarding pack. `onboarding.test.ts` fails if that phrasing regresses to
promising a check.

**What is still enforced**, because neither is about the command:

- The job id must be `uuid4().hex`, and the log path is composed server-side
  from `(project_id, job_id)`. `JobRegistry.status()` falls back to reading a
  `.meta.json` off disk, and `kali_exec` can write into that workspace, so
  trusting the `output_path` it carries was an arbitrary file read on the AGENT
  container - `/proc/self/environ`, and with it `INTERNAL_API_KEY` and the Neo4j
  password. Regression-tested in `LogPathTrustTests`.
- The endpoints require the MASTER internal key, not `SCANNER_API_KEY`, which
  every spawned scan container holds.
- A finished-but-failed job is readable, not a 404, and a run killed at the
  sandbox's 300s cap reports `status=failed` with the reason - never a clean
  exit 0.

## 2. Turning it on

It is **off by default**. A new authenticated inbound surface must be switched on
deliberately, never inherited by upgrading.

```bash
# 1. In .env (redamon.sh writes the switch for you on install)
MCP_SERVER_ENABLED=true

# 2. Apply. The webapp has NO env_file, so this variable is read from the
#    compose `environment:` block - editing .env alone is not enough on its own,
#    but the block is already wired, so a normal restart picks it up.
docker compose up -d webapp
```

`redamon.sh` **refuses** to enable it while `INTERNAL_API_KEY` is unset or still
`changeme`. That is not a formality: the agent's auth fails *open* in that state
(`agentic/llm_guard.py` `_key_ok`) and the base compose publishes the agent on
`0.0.0.0:8090`, so the whole graph-isolation story would rest on a check that is
not running. Run `./redamon.sh install` to generate the secrets first.

### Knobs

All are optional; unset keeps the documented code default. All are wired into the
webapp's compose `environment:` block, because **the webapp has no `env_file`**
and a value set only in `.env` would be silently inert.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MCP_SERVER_ENABLED` | `false` | The master switch. |
| `MCP_KALI_EXEC_ENABLED` | `false` | `kali_exec` / `kali_output` / `kali_cancel`. Independent of the master switch on purpose. |
| `MCP_RATE_EXEC_PER_MIN` | `20` | `kali_exec` calls per token per minute. Polling uses the read bucket. |
| `MCP_TOKEN_RETENTION_DAYS` | `90` | How long revoked/expired token rows are kept before pruning. |
| `MCP_RATE_READ_PER_MIN` | `120` | Cheap reads per token per minute. |
| `MCP_RATE_QUERY_PER_MIN` | `20` | `query_graph` calls per token per minute. |
| `MCP_RATE_WRITE_PER_MIN` | `10` | Settings/stop calls per token per minute. |
| `MCP_RATE_START_PER_WINDOW` | `1` | Scan starts per project per window. |
| `MCP_RATE_START_WINDOW_MS` | `300000` | That window (5 minutes). |
| `MCP_RATE_COMPARE_PER_WINDOW` | `2` | `compare_scan_versions` calls per project per window. Its own bucket, not `query`: one call can gunzip and parse a whole stored graph. |
| `MCP_RATE_COMPARE_WINDOW_MS` | `300000` | That window (5 minutes). |
| `MCP_DISABLED_TOOLS` | (empty) | Comma-separated tool names to withdraw. They disappear from `tools/list` rather than refusing, so a client never plans around them. The per-tool alternative to taking the whole surface down; a name matching no tool is ignored. |
| `MCP_LLM_DAILY_BUDGET` | `200` | NL queries per token per day (they spend the owner's LLM key). |

> **The generated API reference describes a build, not a deployment.** It is
> rendered from the server's own `tools/list` with no tool withdrawn, so a
> deployment using `MCP_DISABLED_TOOLS` advertises fewer tools than the page
> lists. Ask the server itself if you need the authoritative set for one host.

Agent-side bounds (the agent **does** have an `env_file`, so `.env` reaches it):
`NEO4J_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` (120s), `GRAPH_EXEC_MAX_RECORDS` (1000),
`GRAPH_EXEC_MAX_BYTES` (2 MiB), `GRAPH_EXEC_MCP_CONCURRENCY` (2).

## 3. Minting a token

**Global Settings → MCP Server → New token.**

- **Minting is self-only**, judged on your real login identity. An admin viewing
  another user's settings sees the form disabled with a reason: a token minted
  that way would outlive the act-as session, need no further authentication, and
  be indistinguishable from the user's own calls. Admins *can* list, narrow and revoke;
  taking power away is a safe privilege, adding it is not.
- It asks for your **password again**. A stolen 7-day session cookie must not
  silently become a credential that outlives logout.
- **Permissions default to read-only.** Every write permission is opt-in, and
  each says what it allows. `recon:overwrite` says plainly that it permits
  discarding the current graph.
- **An Agent Profile picks the starting permission set** (§3.1). It is a label
  and a suggestion, never an authorization input.
- **`triage:write` is the only write to a finding**, and the only one that
  cannot be undone from this surface except by another verdict. It writes
  `triage_source = 'human'` deliberately: a third provenance value would make
  the finding prune-eligible on the next scan, let a later AI run overwrite the
  verdict, stop `likely_noise` producing a false-positive state, and render as
  "Not reviewed". The channel is recorded on `triage_verdict_channel` instead,
  and the actor on `triage_verdict_by`. It can never mute or unmute.
- **`recon:queue` is separate from `recon:scan`**, because a queued job
  dispatches LATER. `JobQueue` carries no token id and revoking a token writes
  only `revokedAt`, so work queued by a credential OUTLIVES that credential;
  only `cancel_queued_scan` or the Activity view stops it. The same missing
  column means a queued job appears in the operator's own queue attributed to
  them, with nothing marking it as an agent's.
- **`triage:read` is separate from `recon:read` on purpose**, and it is the one
  read permission that is not ticked by default. It unlocks the findings a
  person deliberately suppressed (with who muted them and why) and the
  remediation write-ups. Neither was reachable by any route before, so folding
  them into `recon:read` would have changed what every already-minted token can
  read, with no operator action and no visible change to its permission chips.
- **Expiry** defaults to 90 days. It is re-checked on *every call*, so expiry and
  revocation take effect mid-session rather than at the client's next reconnect.
- The token is shown **once**. Afterwards only its first 8 characters are ever
  displayed.

**Editing a token** (`PATCH /api/users/[id]/mcp-tokens/[tokenId]`) changes its
name, scopes and expiry (`expiry`: `30|60|90|365`, `"never"`, `"now"`, or a
`YYYY-MM-DD` date that lasts to the end of that day UTC). The hash and owner are
never mutable, and a revoked token can only be renamed. Edits are judged by
**direction**:

- **Narrowing** (drop a scope, earlier expiry, `"now"`, rename) keeps the admin
  bypass, like revoke.
- **Widening** (add a scope, later or no expiry, reviving an expired token) gets
  the mint's step-up: self-only on the real identity, password re-confirmed, and
  the same limiter key as minting, so the two share one attempt budget. Without
  this a stolen session cookie could upgrade an existing token into the
  credential it cannot mint. `isTokenWidening` in `webapp/src/lib/mcpAuth.ts` is
  the single rule, used by both the route and the tab.

Scopes and expiry are re-read on every MCP call, so an edit applies on the
agent's next call. Capability edits audit as `mcp-token.update` with
before/after values and `widened`.

**Any password change revokes every token** for that user, including an admin
reset (which needs no current password). A reset that left live programmatic
credentials behind would not actually lock the account.

---

### 3.1 Agent Profiles, and why they are safe

A token is minted FOR A JOB. `McpAccessToken.profile` records which, and the
registry lives in [`webapp/src/lib/mcp/profiles.ts`](../../webapp/src/lib/mcp/profiles.ts).

```prisma
/// NOT an authorization input. Scopes alone are enforced.
profile String?
```

Nullable, so every row minted before the field existed is valid and reads as
`custom`. An UNKNOWN profile is rejected at mint and at PATCH rather than
coerced, mirroring `validateScopes`: silently storing something the operator did
not ask for labels a credential as a job nobody chose.

**The field is never read by any authorization path.** Not `resolveMcpToken`,
not `requireScope`, not the rate limiter, not a tool body. `profiles.test.ts`
enforces this two ways: `mcpAuth.ts` must not contain the string `profile` at
all, and no other module under `src/lib/mcp/` may read `.profile` off a token or
context. A second, weaker authorization path is the one genuinely dangerous
thing this feature could have introduced, so the control is a grep rather than a
convention.

The profile is read in exactly one place on the request path,
[`instructions.ts`](../../webapp/src/lib/mcp/instructions.ts), to choose the
editorial slant of the connect-time onboarding string, and only on `initialize`.
That read selects `{ profile: true }` and nothing else, and any failure falls
back to `custom`: failing to personalise a paragraph must never fail a
connection.

**Profile → recommended scopes.** Every profile starts from `recon:read`, and
seven of the thirteen grant no write of any kind.

| Profile | Recommended | Opt-in (never auto-ticked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bug_bounty` | read, scan, triage:read, cypher | `kali:exec` |
| `pentest` | read, scan, triage:read, cypher | `kali:exec` |
| `asm` | read, scan, queue, triage:read | - |
| `vuln_mgmt` | read, triage:read | - |
| `triage` | read, triage:read, **triage:write** | - |
| `inventory` | read, cypher | - |
| `compliance` | read, triage:read | - |
| `ci_gating` | read, queue, triage:read | - |
| `reporting` | read, triage:read, cypher | - |
| `ma_risk` | read, scan, triage:read, cypher | - |
| `threat_intel` | read, triage:read, cypher | - |
| `soc` | read, cypher | - |
| `research` | read, scan, **settings**, triage:read, cypher | `recon:overwrite`, `kali:exec` |
| `custom` | read | - |

The rules behind it, each asserted in `profiles.test.ts`:

1. **`kali:exec` and `recon:overwrite` are in NO profile's `recommendedScopes`.**
   They may appear only in `optInScopes`, which the form renders unchecked behind
   a danger callout. This is the most important assertion in the feature:
   command execution at a live target and irreversible graph destruction must
   not arrive as a side effect of a dropdown.
2. **`triage:write` and `recon:settings` each go to exactly one profile.**
3. **Unattended profiles prefer `recon:queue`.** `asm` and `ci_gating` run with
   nobody watching, where a direct start just fails on a busy project.
4. **Read-only wherever the job allows it.**

**A profile switch is judged by the existing widening check.** Switching profile
in the UI re-ticks the boxes, and the resulting scope SET flows through
`isTokenWidening` exactly like a hand tick, so a profile-driven widen demands the
same password step-up. A profile change with no scope change grants nothing and
needs no step-up; it is also allowed on a revoked token, like a rename.

### 3.2 Agent Onboarding: generating the pack

[`onboarding.ts`](../../webapp/src/lib/mcp/onboarding.ts) renders the operator's
download, and [`instructions.ts`](../../webapp/src/lib/mcp/instructions.ts) the
connect-time string, from one source. Built like `apiReference.ts`: the
machine-readable half comes from the server's own `tools/list`, so it cannot
describe a tool differently from how the server serves it, and a tool withdrawn
by `MCP_DISABLED_TOOLS` is absent from the pack for free because it never
reaches the list.

**Two filters, deliberately separate:**

- the **scope filter** is hard. `canCall` renders a tool as available only when
  the token holds every required scope; everything else goes in the
  "cannot call" tail with the permission it needs. A conditional scope is
  reported as a withheld ARGUMENT, not a missing tool.
- the **profile filter** is editorial. It chooses which workflows and tone are
  emphasised, and nothing else.

The pack renders **profile ∩ scopes**, plus the cannot-do tail. A profile that
leans on a tool this token cannot reach names the missing PERMISSION, never the
tool, so the profile section can never promise a call that will be refused;
`onboarding.test.ts` asserts exactly that over every profile and several scope
sets.

The hand-written half lives in
[`playbook.ts`](../../webapp/src/lib/mcp/playbook.ts) as three registries, each
guarded by a coverage test: `CAPABILITY_AREAS` (every tool in exactly one area),
`ONBOARDING_PLAYBOOK` (one entry per tool) and `WORKFLOWS` (rendered only when
the token can call every tool they need).

**Adding a tool to the MCP server now also means adding its playbook entry and
filing it under a capability area.** The coverage test goes red in the same
commit otherwise, which is what makes "the pack covers the whole surface" a
guarantee rather than an intention.

Output is deterministic: no dates, and the version stamp is injected, so the
same `(profile, scopes, serverUrl, style, layout)` renders byte-identical bytes.

**Nothing user-specific may enter the output** - no token, no project name, no
target, no rules-of-engagement text - because a `SKILL.md` gets committed into a
repository. The route
(`POST /api/users/[id]/agent-onboarding`) is session-authed with
`requireUserAccess`, not bearer-authed, and it grants nothing: the scopes in its
body describe a document, no token is read and no row is written. The only
caller-controlled string that reaches the file is the server URL, and only its
ORIGIN survives, after an http/https check.

## 4. Connecting a client

The mint dialog renders this pre-filled, so it is copy-paste with no editing:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redamon": {
      "url": "https://<redamon-host>/api/mcp-server",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer rdmn_mcp_<token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

Client support for a **static bearer header on a remote MCP server** varies and
changes, so this document does not assert a list. **Verify your client end to
end before relying on it.** Claude Code, for example:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http redamon https://<host>/api/mcp-server \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer rdmn_mcp_<token>"
```

---

## 5. Behind nginx (single-host deploy)

The deploy template ships an **exact-match** location plus its own rate zone:

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mcp:10m rate=10r/s;
location = /api/mcp-server { ... }
```

Two things worth knowing before you edit it:

- The `=` is load-bearing. A prefix block written `location /api/mcp-server/`
  does **not** match the endpoint URL `/api/mcp-server`; the request silently
  falls through to `location /api/` with the UI rate zone.
- A location carrying any `add_header` does **not** inherit the server-level
  ones, so HSTS/CSP and `Cache-Control` are re-emitted inside the block. Remove
  them and they are silently lost on this endpoint.

**`GATE_MODE=basic_auth` is mutually exclusive with bearer auth** — Basic and
Bearer cannot both travel in one `Authorization` header. Under that mode the
endpoint returns **403 by default**. To open it:

```bash
MCP_EDGE_ALLOW_BEARER=true   # emits `auth_basic off` for this one location
```

### The firewall is a separate gate, and it comes FIRST

This is the step people miss. `MCP_EDGE_ALLOW_BEARER` controls nginx. It does not
control the firewall, and the firewall runs first.

`ufw` scopes the app port to `OPERATOR_ALLOW_CIDRS` whenever that is set (the
recommended posture). It filters by PORT and **cannot see the URL path**, so an
agent connecting from anywhere else is dropped before nginx is consulted at all.
On such a host, flipping `MCP_EDGE_ALLOW_BEARER` alone changes nothing and the
client simply times out.

```bash
MCP_CLIENT_CIDRS=198.51.100.0/24   # where your AGENT connects from
```

That admits those sources to the port, and the exact-match nginx location then
narrows them to `/api/mcp-server` only: they do not gain the UI, the login page
or the agent WebSocket paths.

With no `MCP_CLIENT_CIDRS`, the location inherits the server's `allow`/`deny`
unchanged: the operator gate **and** the token. That is the right posture when
the agent runs on the operator's own network, and the wrong one for a remote
agent.

Three gates, all of which must admit the agent: the cloud Security Group, `ufw`,
then nginx. `./deploy.sh verify` probes the endpoint and tells the failure modes
apart (404 disabled, 401 working, 403 edge gate). Repeated 401s are banned by the
`redamon-mcp-auth` fail2ban jail.

### http-* modes are refused

`deploy.sh` will not enable MCP in an `http-*` ACCESS_MODE, and `ALLOW_INSECURE=1`
does not override it. The credential is a bearer token in a header: over plaintext
it crosses the wire on every call and, unlike a session cookie, it outlives the
session, so one capture is a durable credential.

In `https-ip` with a self-signed certificate most MCP clients reject the
connection. Use a real certificate (`TLS_MODE=provided`) or a domain.

---

## 6. The security model

### Identity

A token resolves to exactly **one** `userId`. There is no admin act-as for
tokens. Every project-scoped tool calls an ownership check first, and a project
that does not exist and one owned by someone else give the **same** answer, so a
token holder cannot enumerate other users' project ids.

That check deliberately does **not** honour `ACCESS_ENFORCE`. The shared
browser-facing guard degrades an ownership violation to a logged warning when
`ACCESS_ENFORCE=0`; on a credentialed, internet-reachable surface that would be a
cross-tenant data breach toggled by an environment variable.

**`ACCESS_ENFORCE=0` and `MCP_SERVER_ENABLED=true` are not a supported
combination**, and this is a known, accepted asymmetry rather than a fix
pending. The hard check above covers the READ side. The browser-side *writers*
that produce some of the rows those reads return - saved graph views,
remediations, queued jobs - authorise with the shared guard, which in that mode
degrades to log-and-allow. The sharpest case is a saved graph view: a different
user could plant a row in this project and an MCP token would later execute it
through `run_graph_view`. The guarantee on the read side cannot be stronger than
the write that created the row.

### The route is bearer-only

It ignores the session cookie, `X-Internal-Key` and `X-Scanner-Key`:

- honouring the cookie would make this middleware-exempt, state-changing POST
  **CSRF-reachable** from a logged-in operator's browser;
- honouring the scanner key would let a leaked token — held by *every* spawned
  scan container, the least-trusted tier — authenticate to the control plane.

It also requires `Content-Type: application/json`, rejects a foreign `Origin`,
rejects JSON-RPC batches, caps the body at 64 KiB, and answers `GET`/`DELETE`
with 405.

### The settings surface

`PUT /api/projects/[id]` spreads its body straight into `prisma.project.update`,
and `Project` has over 700 scalar columns — so anything that reaches it is
written. Describing exclusions in prose is therefore not a control.

**The allowlist stopped being the control; validation at the point of use became
it.** The first version of this surface refused 586 of the 712 columns by name,
which was a crude proxy for "this value could be dangerous" and wrong in both
directions: it refused `nucleiTags`, a bug-class filter, while permitting
`takeoverRateLimit` to run at 500 rps past a 3 rps engagement ceiling.

Every parameter is now described once, in
[`recon_settings/registry.yaml`](../../recon_settings/registry.yaml), and each
one carries a bound or a named validator. Three dispositions decide what a token
may write:

| Disposition | Count | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settable` | 648 | write at any time through `update_recon_settings` |
| `create_only` | 19 | the engagement scope: written once by `create_project`, refused by name afterwards |
| `never` | 47 | not a pipeline parameter at all; refused with its class. 24 of these are the engagement RECORD |

There used to be a fourth, `tighten_only`, holding the Rules of Engagement under
a write-time direction rule. It is deleted rather than migrated. The rule bought
the appearance of a guarantee and not the guarantee: five of the fields it
covered - the whole time window - accepted a WIDENING while reporting a
tightening, because `narrow` has no machine-checkable direction.

What replaced it is that the engagement splits in two. Its 15 LIMITS - the
rate ceiling, the never-touch hosts, the scanning window, the agent's denylists -
are ordinary `settable` fields in the `engagement_limits` group, reachable from
the project form and from `update_recon_settings` alike, in either direction.
What makes them safe is that every one is ENFORCED at scan start whatever the
setting says. Its 24 RECORD columns - the client, the contacts, the dates,
the uploaded document - are `never`, with `deny_reason: engagement-record`: a
person writes them, a model reads them, nothing enforces them, and they carry a
third party's personal data.

A test walking `Prisma.ProjectScalarFieldEnum` fails until every column has an
entry, so a new Prisma field still fails the build until someone describes it —
but describing it is now writing what it means and what it accepts, rather than
deciding whether to refuse it.

The attack this still prevents:

```
update_recon_settings({targetDomain: "victim.com", targetGuardrailEnabled: false})
start_recon()
```

Both fields are `create_only`, so both are refused by name on a project that
already exists, with a pointer to `create_project`. Scope moves with a new
project, never with a new value on an old one. Unknown keys reject the **whole
call by name**, never silently.

**What replaced each deny class.** A rate above the engagement ceiling is
rewritten to the ceiling at scan start. A container image outside the shipped
set is pinned back to the default with a `[guardrail]` line — the precedent
`sanitize_image_settings()` already set. A custom header may not carry CR, LF,
`Host`, `Authorization`, `Cookie` or `Proxy-*`, each of which would change where
a request goes rather than annotate it. A wordlist or template path must resolve
inside this project's own directories, checked at the write AND again at
settings load, because a row also arrives through the webapp, an import and a
version restore.

That last one is not theoretical: ffuf sends each wordlist LINE as a URL path
and records which ones responded, so a wordlist aimed at a file inside the scan
container reflected its contents into the graph. The deny list was the only
thing in front of it.

**Written is not resolved.** `get_recon_settings` echoes what a caller wrote;
`preflight_scope_check` reports what the scan will actually run with. They
differ wherever the runtime corrects a value, and an agent that only read the
first would believe a rejected value was accepted.

### Prompt injection is expected

Everything the graph tools return is derived from scanner output about a live
target: page titles, headers, JS comments, certificate fields, findings text.
That data lands in the *external* agent's context, and that agent holds this
server's tools. Assume an instruction embedded in a page title reaches the model.

| What an injected instruction could try | What stops it |
| --- | --- |
| Redirect the platform at a new target | Scope is `create_only`: refused by name on an existing project, whatever the token holds. A different target means a different project. |
| Discard the victim's graph history | `mode:"overwrite"` needs `recon:overwrite`, off by default. |
| Launch a scan storm | Strict per-token/per-project start bucket + the orchestrator's one-scan-per-project rule. |
| Escalate scan aggression | Aggression is SETTABLE and CAPPED instead of refused. Every rate resolves to at most the engagement ceiling at scan start, and `roeForbiddenTools` / `roeForbiddenCategories` / `roeAllowDos` are checked in code before a tool executes. A `third_party` engagement cannot start without a ceiling at all. |
| Loosen the engagement to make room | Nothing REFUSES it, and that is deliberate: a write-time direction rule covered five fields it could not actually check. What stops it mattering is that the limits are applied at scan start regardless, the change is audited with a before and an after, and `preflight_scope_check` reports the RESOLVED configuration rather than the written one. A queued job whose limits changed goes to `needs_review` instead of dispatching. |
| Disable the engagement limits wholesale | There is no flag to write. `roeEnabled` is derived from whether any limit is SET, so removing a limit means removing it visibly rather than flipping one boolean and leaving every field displaying its old value. |
| Point a scan tool at a local file | A wordlist or template path must resolve inside this project's own directories, checked at the write and again at settings load. |
| Make the scan run an attacker's container | Every `*DockerImage` field is a closed list of the shipped images and an out-of-set value is REFUSED at the write. It used to be accepted and pinned back at scan start, which contained the danger but not the dishonesty: `get_recon_settings` echoed an image the scan would never run. |
| Reconfigure a job already in the queue | The C-4 fingerprint covers every field that steers where or how hard a job scans, including every engagement limit and the DERIVED answer to whether they are live, so the job goes to `needs_review` instead of dispatching. |
| Exfiltrate another tenant's data | Ownership check + `scope_query` + result post-validation. |
| Exfiltrate secrets | No tool returns a credential. |
| Burn the owner's LLM budget | Per-token daily budget. |
| Aim a command at a third party | **Nothing, once `kali:exec` is granted.** See below. |
| Smuggle a second command | **Nothing, and nothing is meant to.** A shell is the feature. |
| Read the sandbox's own environment or keys | **Nothing, once `kali:exec` is granted.** See below. |

### The `kali:exec` residual, stated plainly

The three rows above used to claim a per-host scope check, an allowlist that
admitted no interpreter, and path confinement. **None of those exist any more.**
`kali_exec` is `bash -c` in the sandbox (§1.1), so an agent holding that scope
can run any installed binary against any host the sandbox can reach, use
pipelines and redirection freely, and read the sandbox's own process
environment.

That environment is not empty. At the time of writing the kali-sandbox
container carries `SCANNER_API_KEY`, `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` and `TUNNEL_AUTH_TOKEN`,
so `env` is a credential read. `SCANNER_API_KEY` is the one to weigh: this route
deliberately refuses `X-Scanner-Key` as an inbound credential precisely because
the scanner tier is the least trusted, and an agent that can read it out of the
sandbox has recovered what the route declined to accept.

Two consequences worth stating rather than leaving to inference:

- **On a cloud deploy the instance metadata endpoint is reachable**
  (`169.254.169.254`), which on AWS returns the instance role's credentials.
  Nothing on this path refuses it.
- **Scope is the operator's judgement, not the code's.** The containment for
  `kali:exec` is entirely in who gets the scope: it is off by default, needs
  `MCP_KALI_EXEC_ENABLED` on the deployment AND a per-project opt-in, and every
  call is audited. With no refusal path left, **the audit row is the only record
  of what an agent did with the shell**, which makes it more load-bearing than
  when a guard existed.

Grant `kali:exec` only to an agent you would trust with a terminal on that box,
and prefer a deployment where the sandbox holds no credential you would mind
losing.

The other residual: a compromised external agent can do, within one user's own
projects, whatever that user's token already permits. That is inherent to
delegating a credential, and is why the default token is read-only.

### Result post-validation

Every node and relationship returned by a graph tool is re-checked against the
caller's tenant **on the way out**, and a violation drops the *whole* response
and writes an error-level audit record. This is defence in depth, not the primary
control — `scope_query` scopes the query server-side — but that filter has failed
once already (an unlabelled `MATCH (n)` once bypassed it), and on an
internet-reachable surface the same regression would be a *remote* cross-tenant
breach. Scalar projections carry no tenant keys to check; that residual is
accepted and bounded by `scope_query` alone.

## 7. Audit

Every call writes an `AuditLog` row: `mcp.<tool>`, the actor, the project, and
the token id and prefix. **Failures are audited too** — invalid, expired and
revoked token presentations (by prefix, never the token), scope denials,
ownership 404s and every post-validation violation — because that is the only way
a token brute force or a replayed revoked token becomes visible.

A `start_recon` also produces the normal `ScanJob` history row with
`initiatedByUserId` set to the token owner, and the audit record carries the
`scanJobId` so a run traces back to a token.

There is **no audit-log viewer in the product**: reconstruction is a SQL query
against `audit_log`. Known and accepted; a minimal admin view is a follow-up.

---

## 8. Operational notes

- **Settings apply to the NEXT scan.** Recon reads its settings once, at
  container spawn, so `update_recon_settings` refuses while a scan is writing the
  graph rather than accepting a write that would do nothing.
- **`start_recon` is stricter than the button.** It also refuses while a human is
  mid-session with the in-app agent or a triage run. Those are excluded from the
  normal check because a person running both is normal *and can see both*; an
  unattended external caller cannot, and a full scan would wipe the graph
  underneath them.
- **`mode:"new"` consumes a retention slot.** Old unpinned versions are trimmed
  past `SCAN_VERSION_RETENTION_KEEP` (default 20).
- **A dependency failure is never an empty result.** An unreachable orchestrator
  reports "status unknown", never "not running"; a graph failure never returns an
  empty summary. Conflating the two produces a false negative in a security tool.
