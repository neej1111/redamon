/**
 * The `instructions` string the server sends at `initialize`.
 *
 * This is the ONLY onboarding most clients ever receive. Only the Claude family
 * loads a `SKILL.md`; Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Goose, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI and
 * anything built on LangGraph, the OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI or n8n see the tool
 * list and nothing else. Without this they get thirty tool descriptions and none
 * of the judgement that spans them.
 *
 * Rendered from the same source as the downloadable pack, so the two cannot
 * teach different things.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices about WHERE this work happens:
 *
 *  - the profile is read HERE, not in `resolveMcpToken`. mcpAuth.ts owns
 *    resolution, scope checks and rate limiting, and it must not so much as
 *    mention a profile, or the field starts looking like an authorization input.
 *    profiles.test.ts asserts that. This is a separate, clearly editorial read.
 *  - it runs only on `initialize`. The transport is stateless, so the server is
 *    rebuilt for every request; doing this per tool call would add a database
 *    read and a tool-list build to every call, for a string nobody reads again.
