"""
T6, T39, T40, T41: what the registry actually does at settings load.

The registry's own tests prove its structure. These prove its EFFECT, which is
the only thing a scope violation cares about. The distinction is not academic:
`PUREDNS_RATE_LIMIT` was in the shipped cap list and ran unlimited anyway,
because being in a list is not the same as being capped.

So every assertion here reads a RESOLVED value, and the exhaustive cases iterate
the registry rather than naming fields, because the registry is the list of
things that could regress.
