# RedAmon testing guide

This document has two audiences: the human maintainer, and **the next Claude Code
session, which reads it before writing or running a test**. It is therefore an
applied rulebook, not just reference. If you are about to add or run a test, read
the [authoring rules](#test-authoring-rules-hard-rules) first.

---

## TL;DR

```bash
./redamon.sh test              # unit gate across every section (the canonical gate)
./redamon.sh test unit         # same
./redamon.sh test integration  # integration tier (heavier deps / cross-layer)
./redamon.sh test all          # unit + integration
./redamon.sh test live         # live tier (self-skips when the stack is down)
./redamon.sh test coverage     # all tiers + per-section coverage + floor

./agentic/run_tests.sh         # just the agent image, unit gate (fast path)
./agentic/run_tests.sh coverage
./agentic/run_tests.sh tests/test_foo.py::TestBar::test_baz   # one node id
```

The **unit tier must be 100% green** — that is the gate (the modern replacement for
the old hand-maintained 31-module `focused` list; `focused` still works as an
alias for `unit`).

## How it is built

- Runner: **pytest**, which runs the existing `unittest.TestCase` tests unchanged.
  This was a runner swap, not a test rewrite.
- Tests run **inside each section's Docker image** (where `pydantic`, `langgraph`,
  `tree-sitter`, ripgrep, etc. live). The whole repo is mounted at `/repo` so
  cross-layer tests and `git HEAD` resolve.
- Config lives at each in-container test root: a small `pytest.ini` +
  `conftest.py` at `agentic/`, `recon/`, `recon_orchestrator/`,
  `scanners/ai_attack_surface_scan/`, `scanners/capture_proxy/`, `services/docker_broker/`, and the repo root.
  Keep the `conftest.py` copies in sync — they are intentionally near-identical.
- Test deps are `requirements-test.txt` (`pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `pytest-xdist`,
  `pytest-asyncio`). They are **baked** into the daily-driver images
  (`agentic/requirements.txt`, `recon/requirements.txt`) and **runtime-installed**
  into the occasional-run slim images by the runner.

### Section / image map

| Section | Image | Test root(s) |
|---|---|---|
| agent | `redamon-agent` | `agentic/tests` |
| root group | `redamon-agent` | `tests/`, `supply_chain_*`, `graph_db`, `knowledge_base`, `mcp` |
| recon | `redamon-recon` | `recon/tests` |
| recon_orchestrator | `redamon-recon-orchestrator` | `recon_orchestrator/` + `recon_orchestrator/tests` |
| ai_attack_surface | `redamon-ai-attack-surface` | `scanners/ai_attack_surface_scan/tests` + `adapters/*/tests` |
| capture_proxy | `redamon-capture-proxy` | `scanners/capture_proxy/tests` |
| docker_broker | `redamon-docker-broker` | `services/docker_broker/` |
| shell | (host bash) | `tests/*_test.sh` |
| webapp | (node) | `webapp/src/**/*.test.ts(x)` via vitest |

A section whose image is not built is **skipped cleanly**, never failed.

### The `shell` section

Parts of RedAmon are bash, not Python: the proportional memory allocator, the
preflight RAM/disk gates, secret and admin handling, and the `tooling/deploy`
driver. Those are covered by `tests/*_test.sh`, which run **on the host** (they
`source redamon.sh` — the `BASH_SOURCE` guard at the bottom of the script stops
the command dispatch from firing) and need no image.

They run in the same tiers as webapp (`unit`, `all`, `coverage`), so the
canonical `./redamon.sh test` gate covers them. Every suite matched by the glob
must be **hermetic or self-skipping**: one that needs a live stack (e.g.
`scan_timeline_db_test.sh` without postgres) prints a `SKIP` line and exits 0.
Smoke/live shell suites are named `*_smoke.sh` / `*_live.sh` and are deliberately
not matched.

### Two oracles, and only one of them runs in CI

Some unit-tier files mix hermetic checks with checks that need a live Neo4j and
self-skip without one. The graph-schema suites are the example, and the split is
deliberate rather than accidental:

| Check | Needs a database | Runs in the gate |
|---|---|---|
| every relationship/property the CODE writes is documented (`test_graph_writes_documented.py`) | no | **yes** |
| every relationship/property in a LIVE graph is documented (`test_schema_catalog.py`) | yes | no, skips |

Both are needed because neither sees everything. The code scan misses the 22
labels written with `SET n += $props`, where the property names are assembled in
Python and appear in no file. The live graph misses every feature this
particular deployment never ran.

So a green gate does NOT mean the live-graph checks passed - it usually means
they skipped. Run them against a stack before trusting a schema change:

```bash
NEO4J_PASSWORD="$(grep '^NEO4J_PASSWORD=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)" \
docker run --rm --network host --entrypoint python3 \
  -e NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687 -e NEO4J_USER=neo4j -e NEO4J_PASSWORD="$NEO4J_PASSWORD" \
  -v "$PWD:/work:ro" -w /work redamon-recon:latest recon/tests/test_schema_catalog.py
```

A failing file is reported with the command to re-run it on its own:

```
  FAIL  redamon_governor_test.sh (exit 1) — re-run: bash tests/redamon_governor_test.sh
```

---

## Tiers and auto-tiering

Three markers: `unit`, `integration`, `live`. Rather than editing hundreds of
files, each `conftest.py` auto-marks by **filename**:

- `*_integration.py`, `*_skill.py`, `*_e2e*` -> **integration**
- `live_*`, `*_live*`, `*_smoke*`, `smoke_*` -> **live** (self-skip when a stack is down)
- everything else -> **unit**

Override with an explicit `@pytest.mark.{unit,integration,live}`, on the file or
on a single test inside it.

The gate engine (`tooling/scripts/pytest_isolated.py`) infers the same tiers from the
filename to pick which FILES to run, so the two must stay consistent - and it also
passes the tier to pytest as `-m`, so a single test that has opted out of the tier
its filename implies is honoured. Without that `-m`, filename selection alone
cannot see inside a file: a wall-clock test marked `integration` still ran in the
unit gate and failed whenever the parallel run loaded the host.

---

## Determinism: why each test file runs in its own process

A large body of these tests was written for the old per-file
`python -m unittest tests.test_x` runner, where **every file was its own process**.
Many of them, at import time:

- stub `langchain`/`langgraph` into `sys.modules` (`if X not in sys.modules: ...`), and
- **bake real tool objects against a fake `@tool` decorator** during import.

In a single shared pytest process this is order-dependent: whichever file is
collected first decides for all of them, so e.g. the Shodan tool silently becomes
a `MagicMock` and its tests fail with *"a coroutine was expected, got
`<MagicMock>`"*. This is exactly the class of phantom failure that sends an AI
author "fixing" code that was never broken.

The fix is structural: the gate runs **each test FILE in its own pytest
subprocess**, parallelized, via `tooling/scripts/pytest_isolated.py`. That reproduces the
isolation the tests were designed for and makes the gate deterministic.

Consequences you must know:

- `./redamon.sh test` / `./agentic/run_tests.sh` are deterministic. Prefer them.
- Running `pytest -m unit` over the **whole tree in one process** is *not* the gate
  and may show phantom failures from legacy import-time stubbing. Each
  `conftest.py` adds a `pytest_ignore_collect` that makes a single-process
  `-m unit` run at least skip importing the heavier integration/live files, but
  per-file isolation is still the source of truth.
- A single file, or a single node id, is already isolated — use that while iterating.

Two determinism helpers also live in every `conftest.py`:

- an autouse `_ensure_event_loop` fixture (restores a usable event loop after a
  `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` sets it to `None`), and
- the auto-tiering + `-m unit` path-scoping hooks above.

---

## The surgical loop (iterate cheaply)

Each containerized full run costs latency + context. When a test is red, do NOT
re-run the whole suite. Read the precise failure and re-run just that test:

```bash
# one node id, single process (isolated), short traceback:
./agentic/run_tests.sh tests/test_execute_nodes.py::TestCheckRoeBlocked::test_forbidden_tool_blocked

# stop at first failure while iterating, re-run only last failures:
./agentic/run_tests.sh tests/test_foo.py -x
./agentic/run_tests.sh tests/test_foo.py --lf
```

`addopts` in each `pytest.ini` already sets `-ra --tb=short --strict-markers -p
no:cacheprovider` for concise, deterministic output.

---

## Coverage

`./redamon.sh test coverage` (or `./agentic/run_tests.sh coverage`) runs the
unit+integration tiers with `pytest-cov` and prints per-section totals.
`COVERAGE_FILE=/tmp/redamon.coverage` keeps root-owned `.coverage` files out of
the bind mount.

Coverage runs **serially with `--cov-append`** (parallel appends can corrupt the
data file). The floor is enforced with `--cov-fail-under`; set it per section via
`REDAMON_COV_FLOOR` (or the section spec in `redamon.sh`).

To **ratchet** a floor: run coverage, read the section total, set the floor to
`floor(total) - 2`. Measured agentic total (unit+integration) is **81%** — once
the import-time pollution was fixed, real coverage was far above the depressed
41% the old polluted `discover` run reported — so the agentic floor is **79**
(`REDAMON_COV_FLOOR`, default in `agentic/run_tests.sh`). supply_chain baseline
to beat is 72%.

> **The floor guards against rot, not quality.** Because an AI writes these tests,
> the number is gameable by hollow tests that execute code and assert nothing. The
> real quality gate — mutation testing on security-critical modules — is future
> work. The interim defense is the authoring rules below.

---

## Test-authoring rules (hard rules)

1. **Assert on behavior and output, not mere execution.** A test that runs code
   but checks nothing is worse than no test — it inflates coverage and asserts
   nothing.
2. **Name each test as the guarantee it enforces**
   (`test_edit_rejects_non_unique_target`), never `test_edit_2`. The name is the
   spec a human reviews.
3. **Do not assert "current behavior" you have not confirmed is correct.** Tests
   must not enshrine bugs. If a test reveals a real bug, mark it
   `@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True, reason=...)` and surface it — do not rewrite
   it to pass.
4. **Never mock the unit under test.** Keep an `integration` test that exercises
   the real dependency so the mocks cannot drift from reality.
5. **Never mutate global state (`sys.modules`, `os.environ`, cwd) at import time.**
   Use fixtures or `mock.patch.dict(sys.modules, {...})` / `mock.patch.dict(
   os.environ, {...})` scoped to a single test. If you must shim at import time
   (e.g. to import a module on bare Python), **capture the originals and restore
   them in `tearDownModule()`** — see `agentic/tests/test_t14_prompt_injection_previews.py`
   for the reference pattern. Leaving a stub in place drops later-imported victims
   to 0% coverage and breaks their collection.

### Environmental prerequisites (bucket 2)

A test that needs a live stack, a network service, a tool binary, or git HEAD
must **self-skip cleanly** (`skipUnless`/`skipIf` / `raise unittest.SkipTest`),
never hard-fail. If it currently hard-fails on a missing prerequisite, that
missing skip-guard *is* the bug.

---

## Adding a test to a tier

- **unit**: name it `test_*.py` with no special suffix. It must be hermetic (no
  network, no running stack) and pass in its own process.
- **integration**: name it `*_integration.py` / `*_skill.py`, or add
  `@pytest.mark.integration`. It may reach across layers / use heavier deps.
- **live**: name it `live_*` / `*_live*` / `*_smoke*`, or add `@pytest.mark.live`,
  and make it self-skip when the stack/service is absent.

---

## Future work / next steps

- **CI**: run the unit gate on every PR and the full `all` tier nightly.
- **Mutation testing** on the security-critical modules (supply-chain, auth /
  access control) as the *real* quality gate — coverage alone is not one.
- **HTTP record/replay** (`respx` / VCR) so the `live` tier shrinks.
- **Playwright e2e** wired into the gate (see `testing/e2e/`).
