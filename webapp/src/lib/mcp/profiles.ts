/**
 * Agent Profiles: the job a token is minted FOR.
 *
 * A profile does two independent things, and keeping them apart is the whole
 * design:
 *
 *  - it SUGGESTS a scope set at mint time, so an operator picking "SOC
 *    enrichment" does not have to work out that the safe answer is two read
 *    permissions and nothing else;
 *  - it selects the editorial lens of the generated onboarding pack, so the
 *    agent is taught the half of RedAmon its job actually uses.
 *
 * It is NEVER an authorization input. `resolveMcpToken`, `requireScope` and
 * every tool body read `scopes` and nothing else; a token's power is exactly its
 * ticked permissions whatever its profile says. profiles.test.ts asserts that no
 * authorization path reads this field, because a second, weaker authorization
 * path is the one genuinely dangerous thing this feature could introduce.
 *
 * Two scopes are deliberately absent from every `recommendedScopes` list:
 * `kali:exec` reaches a live target outside a scan, and `recon:overwrite`
 * destroys a graph irreversibly. Neither may arrive as a side effect of choosing
 * from a dropdown, so the profiles that want them carry them in `optInScopes`,
 * which the form renders as an UNCHECKED recommendation.
