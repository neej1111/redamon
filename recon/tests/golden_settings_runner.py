"""
Resolve one synthetic project row to the settings a scan would actually run with.

Shared by the golden-master test and the regeneration script, so the baseline
and the assertion are produced by exactly the same code path. If they were two
implementations, a bug in either would look like agreement.

The full path is run, not just `fetch_project_settings`: stealth, then the RoE
capper inside the fetch, then the AI-pipeline overrides, then the memory
governor. Ordering is load-bearing and documented in `project_settings.py`, and
a refactor that reorders the passes produces different effective settings with
nothing failing.

The memory governor reads live host memory, so it is disabled here: a baseline
that changes with the machine's free RAM would be a baseline nobody trusts. Its
ORDERING is asserted separately, by the runtime tests.
