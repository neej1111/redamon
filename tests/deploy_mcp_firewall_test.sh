# =============================================================================
# The ufw rules the MCP client CIDRs actually produce.
# Run:  bash tests/deploy_mcp_firewall_test.sh
#
# WHY: this is the gate operators hit first and understand last. The firewall
# filters by PORT and cannot see a URL path, so when OPERATOR_ALLOW_CIDRS is
# set, an agent connecting from anywhere else is dropped before nginx is ever
# consulted. The symptom is a TIMEOUT, not a 403, so it looks like the server is
# down rather than like a policy decision -- and turning MCP_EDGE_ALLOW_BEARER
# on, which is the documented fix for the 403, changes nothing at all here.
#
# The module's real functions are sourced with `ufw` stubbed, so what is
# asserted is the rule set that would be installed, not the presence of a line
# of code that looks like it would install one.
#
# Only documentation-range addresses appear here (RFC 5737).
