/**
 * The queue: "run it when the machine is free" instead of a dead end.
 *
 * A busy project is a hard refusal today. `start_recon` says no, and the agent
 * has no way to express "later", so it must invent a retry loop against a
 * per-project window that only allows one start every five minutes. The Scan
 * Queue already exists and the UI already uses it.
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN SCOPE, and it is not bureaucracy. A queued job dispatches LATER,
 * and there is no way to cancel it when the token is revoked: `JobQueue`
 * carries no token id and revoking writes only `revokedAt`, so work queued by a
 * credential outlives the credential. That is a materially different grant from
 * "start a scan now", and folding it into `recon:scan` would retroactively
 * widen every token already minted.
 *
 * Only the FULL recon is queueable. Partial recon lets the caller name hosts,
 * which makes its inputs target fields in disguise, and the other scanners each
 * need their own preconditions.
