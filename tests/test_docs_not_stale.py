"""P18-P20: the published and agent-facing docs do not name what no longer exists.

Deliberately crude. These cannot tell whether a page is well written, only
whether it still names something that was deleted - which is the failure that
actually happens, and the one that is worst where it happens:

  a WIKI page          two of them are mirrored to redamon.org, so a stale claim
                       is public rather than internal
  an AGENT-FACING      the guides under docs/readmes/coding_agent_prompts/ are
  guide                the instructions a coding agent follows. A stale line
                       there does not mislead a reader, it produces wrong code
                       that passes review because the guide said to write it
  a runtime string     playbook.ts is read by the connected agent at run time,
                       so a line naming a deleted tool sends it after something
                       that answers "unknown tool"
