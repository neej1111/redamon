"""
Descriptions for the recon parameters no existing source documents.

`RECON_PARAMETER_CATALOG` covers 474 fields and the ProjectForm hints cover more,
but roughly 280 columns reach the registry with nothing to say about them, and a
field an agent cannot read about is one it guesses at.

Two mechanisms, and the split is deliberate:

  TEMPLATES  formulaic families where the name genuinely determines the meaning
             (a `*DockerImage`, a `*Timeout`, a per-check toggle). Writing 200
             near-identical sentences by hand would produce 200 chances to get
             one subtly wrong.

  OVERRIDES  everything carrying real semantics: the RoE block, the targeting
             columns, the zero-means-unlimited rates, anything whose behaviour
             would surprise a reader who only had the name.

A template never wins over an override. No test can check that a description is
TRUE, so the rule is that anything non-obvious goes in OVERRIDES where a human
wrote it deliberately.
