  # The filter the jail above references. 401 is the ONLY code matched: the route
  # returns 401 for every credential failure (missing, invalid, revoked, expired)
  # and distinct codes for everything else, so this cannot fire on a healthy
  # client that is merely rate-limited (429) or on a disabled server (404).
  #
  # The path is bounded by ` HTTP/` or a query string rather than left open, so
  # it matches this endpoint and not everything sharing its prefix: an open
  # `[^"]*` tail would also ban on a 401 from a future /api/mcp-server-<x>
  # route. tests/deploy_mcp_fail2ban_test.sh runs the corpus this was tuned on.
