"""The generated graph-schema catalog and renderer.

Two jobs, and they pull in opposite directions on purpose.

**1. Nothing was lost.** The catalog was seeded by slicing the hand-written
`TEXT_TO_CYPHER_SYSTEM` into addressable segments. `render_schema()` with no
arguments must reproduce the committed baseline fixture BYTE-FOR-BYTE. That is
what turns "the dynamic version has everything the hardcoded one had" from a
claim into a fact: the prose was cut, never re-typed, re-wrapped or summarised.
If someone edits the catalog and the render drifts, this goes red and the diff
shows exactly what moved.

**2. Nothing new goes missing.** `graph_db/schema.py` is the executable truth
about which labels exist. A label declared there with no catalog entry means the
agent silently cannot query that node type: no error, no warning, just an
authoritative-looking empty answer. That failure mode is why this file exists.
