"""P9-P13: the RoE parse prompt is generated, current, and honest about bounds.

The parse path used to hold the same field list in THREE places that nothing
reconciled: a JSON skeleton in `_ROE_PARSE_PROMPT`, a `fieldMap` in
`RoeSection.tsx`, and the registry. Measured before the change, they had NOT
drifted - because two people kept two lists in step by hand. That is the
property that does not survive a codebase adding recon fields weekly, and
"correct today by diligence" is exactly what is worth converting into "correct
by construction" while it is still true.

Three ways it went stale, each silent:

    a column is renamed   the prompt asks for the old name, the model returns
                          it, the handler sets a key that no longer exists
    a field is added      the parser cannot set it whatever the document says
    a bound changes       the model is told one range and judged against
                          another, so the rejection reads as a model error

The third is the nastiest now that parsed values go through the registry
validators, which is why P11 compares what the model is TOLD against what the
validator ENFORCES rather than checking each in isolation.
