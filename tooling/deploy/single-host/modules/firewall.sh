# firewall.sh -- ufw as the portable host firewall (§10).
# Reads (exported by deploy.sh): MCP_SERVER_ENABLED, MCP_CLIENT_CIDRS, ENABLE_UFW, HTTP_PORT, HTTPS_PORT, SSH_PORT,
#   SSH_ALLOW_CIDRS (falls back to OPERATOR_ALLOW_CIDRS), OPERATOR_ALLOW_CIDRS,
#   ACCESS_MODE, REVSHELL_TARGET_CIDRS.
# Requires _common.sh.
#
# Docker-bypass caveat: Docker publishes ports via its own iptables chains and can
# bypass ufw. The loopback re-binds in the prod overlay are the REAL control for
# 3000/8090/4444; ufw here is belt-and-braces + the SSH lockdown.

# Admit the MCP client CIDRs to the app port, on top of the operator CIDRs.
#
# The firewall cannot filter by URL path, so this necessarily opens the PORT to
# those sources. The path-level narrowing is nginx's job: the exact-match
# `location = /api/mcp-server` re-states its own allow/deny, so an MCP client
# CIDR reaches the MCP endpoint and nothing else. Without this, ufw drops the
# agent's packet before nginx ever sees the path, and MCP_EDGE_ALLOW_BEARER is
# necessary but not sufficient.
#
# Only meaningful when OPERATOR_ALLOW_CIDRS is set; with no operator list the
# port is already world-open and there is nothing extra to admit.

  # `revshell-close` tears it back down. See the README "Reverse shell" section.
