# The inbound MCP endpoint's nginx location.
# Run:  bash tests/deploy_mcp_nginx_test.sh
#
# Two traps this pins, both of which fail SILENTLY in production:
#
# 1. EXACT MATCH. A prefix block written `location /api/mcp-server/ {` does NOT
#    match the endpoint URL `/api/mcp-server`. The request would fall through to
#    `location /api/` and get the UI rate zone plus - under
#    GATE_MODE=basic_auth - a gate that eats the Authorization header the
#    client needs. Nothing errors; MCP just stops working, or works with the
#    wrong limits.
#
# 2. HEADER INHERITANCE. A location carrying ANY add_header does not inherit the
#    server-level ones, so HSTS/CSP and Cache-Control are lost unless re-emitted.
#    The template already records this trap on the login location; this endpoint
#    has the same shape.
#
# Plus the §14.2 decision: under basic_auth the endpoint is CLOSED by default,
# because Basic and Bearer cannot both travel in one Authorization header.
#
# The rendered configs are validated with a real `nginx -t` when Docker is
# available, and skipped cleanly when it is not.
