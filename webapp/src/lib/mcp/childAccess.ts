/**
 * Ownership for the child rows MCP tools address by id.
 *
 * `assertMcpProjectAccess` proves the PARENT and nothing else: it takes a
 * projectId, checks `Project.userId`, and never sees a versionId, jobId, viewId
 * or remediationId. Every one of those is a bare cuid that `findUnique` will
 * happily resolve across tenants - and a `ScanVersion` is a gzipped dump of an
 * entire attack-surface graph.
 *
 * There was nothing to reuse. The existing checks either inline the pattern in
 * a route while calling the session-based, ACCESS_ENFORCE-aware `guardProject`,
 * or take a browser `EffectiveUser`; neither is reachable from a bearer token,
 * and neither refuses in the mode where `ACCESS_ENFORCE=0` degrades an
 * ownership violation to a logged warning.
 *
 * So: one module, and no tool may reach a child row any other way. Each helper
 * proves the PARENT with `assertMcpProjectAccess` first, then re-resolves the
 * owning projectId FROM THE ROW. A row that is missing and a row belonging to
 * someone else take the same path to the same message, so neither id space can
 * be enumerated - see `childNotFound` for why that message names the child.
 *
 * A graph `nodeId` needs no helper here and deliberately has none: the triage
 * mixin's own WHERE carries `n.user_id` and `n.project_id` plus the
 * muteable-label expression, so a foreign id matches zero rows server-side.

/**

 *
 * It names the CHILD rather than reusing `McpAccessDenied`'s flat "Project not
 * found". Every caller of these helpers has already cleared
 * `assertMcpProjectAccess` one line above, so the project demonstrably exists
 * and is theirs; answering "Project not found" sent an agent off to retry with
 * a different projectId over a bad viewId, which is the retry loop this surface
 * is written to avoid.
 *
 * The distinction that must NOT leak is foreign-versus-missing, and this
 * preserves it exactly: both cases produce this identical message. The project
 * boundary itself is untouched - a foreign PROJECT still fails earlier, in
 * `assertMcpProjectAccess`, with the flat message.
