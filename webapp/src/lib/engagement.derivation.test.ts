/**
 * P7: the two derivations of `roeEnabled` agree, and nobody reads the column.
 *
 * The rule lives in `recon_settings/engagement.py` for recon, the agent and the
 * orchestrator, and in `deriveRoeEnabled` here for the webapp. The webapp cannot
 * import Python, so the copy is unavoidable; what is avoidable is the two
 * copies disagreeing, which is the exact two-sources-of-truth failure the
 * derivation exists to end.
 *
 * So both read one fixture table. `recon_settings/tests/test_engagement_derivation.py`
 * asserts the same rows against the Python implementation. Adding a row here
 * tests both languages; changing one implementation without the other fails on
 * one side.
