"""
Regenerate the resolved-settings golden master baselines.

Deliberately NOT a test and never called from one. A baseline that a test run
can rewrite is not a baseline: the first refactor that changes behaviour would
quietly update the file it was supposed to fail against.

Run it only when a settings change is intended, and read the diff:

    docker run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo/recon \\
      -e PYTHONPATH=/repo:/repo/recon -e HOME=/tmp --entrypoint sh redamon-recon \\
      -c 'python /repo/recon/tests/regen_golden_settings.py'
    git diff recon/tests/fixtures/golden_settings/

`-u` is not optional. Without it the container writes the baselines as root and
the host cannot rewrite or even `git checkout` them afterwards.

Every line of that diff is a value some scan will now run with.
