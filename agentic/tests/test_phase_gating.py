"""
Unit + regression tests for project_settings.is_tool_allowed_in_phase()
after the Phase-2 fs_*/job_* foundational-tool bypass was added.

Covers:
  - fs_* and job_* are allowed in every phase (foundational bypass)
  - Pre-existing TOOL_PHASE_MAP entries still work (regression)
  - Unknown tool with no manifest entry still returns False (regression)
  - Bypass uses prefix match - 'fs_x' / 'job_x' work, 'fsx' / 'fooFs' don't

Run with: python3 -m unittest tests.test_phase_gating -v
