/**
 * Preserve the record of what authorized a project, past the project.
 *
 * Every other `Project` child is `onDelete: Cascade`, which would have destroyed
 * the authorization records the moment the project was deleted - the single
 * thing an incident review needs most, gone with the row it was about. The
 * relation is `onDelete: Restrict` instead, so a delete that has not archived
 * them fails rather than silently taking them with it.
 *
 * This is the archiving half. It copies the rows into
 * `engagement_authorization_archive`, sets the session flag the append-only
 * trigger checks, and removes the originals, all inside one transaction, so a
 * failure anywhere leaves both the project and its records intact.
 *
 * The archive table IS a Prisma model, and was deliberately not one until an
 * end-to-end run showed what that cost. `prisma db push --accept-data-loss`
 * drops every table the schema does not know about, and this is the table the
 * delete path must write to before it is allowed to remove a project. Outside
 * the schema it survived only until the next push; in the window between that
 * push and the next webapp boot - which is where the boot script re-creates it -
 * every project holding an authorization record was undeletable, failing with an
 * opaque 500. Since `db push` is how this repo applies schema changes, that
 * window was ordinary working practice.
 *
 * The original reason for keeping it out was that a model would appear in every
 * `select`-building helper that walks the datamodel. No such helper exists: all
 * three callers of `Prisma.dmmf` look up `Project` by name. Nothing in the
 * application reads this table; it is still queried with SQL, by a person,
 * during an investigation.
