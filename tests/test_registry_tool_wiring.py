"""
T10, T11, T13: every module, wrapper and graph writer a tool claims is importable.

The TypeScript side checks the links it can see from a file listing: an image in
the pull list, a section file on disk, a partial-recon module by name. It cannot
import Python, so the half that matters most is here.

`isolated_fn` is the one worth stating plainly. It is the actual fan-out call
path: a tool wired without it works in single mode and silently never runs in a
parallel plan, which is the failure this whole alignment layer exists to make
loud. So the assertion is that the attribute exists AND is callable, not that
the import succeeded.

Runs in the `root-recon` section, which is the one with the recon package
importable.

Run: python -m pytest tests/test_registry_tool_wiring.py -v
