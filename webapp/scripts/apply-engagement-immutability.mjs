/**
 * Make `engagement_authorizations` append-only in Postgres.
 *
 * The model is the record of WHAT AUTHORIZED an engagement, and it is only
 * evidence if it cannot be rewritten. An agent holding `engagement:authorize`
 * can make a durable claim that a given document permitted a given scan; a row
 * it could later edit would let it unmake that claim after the fact, which is
 * the one property the model exists to have.
 *
 * Prisma has no immutability primitive, so saying "append-only" in a model
 * comment is documentation rather than enforcement. This is the enforcement: a
 * trigger that raises on UPDATE and DELETE, so the rule holds against the ORM,
 * against psql, and against a future code path nobody has written yet.
 *
 * It runs from the webapp entrypoint AFTER `db push`, for the same reason
 * apply-ingest-role.mjs and apply-traffic-fts.mjs do: the push drops objects it
 * does not know about, so anything added outside the Prisma schema has to be
 * re-applied on every boot. Idempotent by construction.
 *
 * The one deliberate hole: deleting the PROJECT. Every other Project child
 * cascades, which would have destroyed the record of what authorized a project
 * the moment the project was deleted - the thing an incident review needs most.
 * The relation is `onDelete: Restrict` instead, and the delete path copies the
 * rows to `engagement_authorization_archive` first. That copy is what the DELETE
 * exemption below is for, and it is scoped to exactly that: a session that has
 * set `redamon.archiving_project`.
