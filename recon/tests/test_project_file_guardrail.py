"""
T22: path-valued settings cannot point a scan tool at an arbitrary file.

Several columns hold a filesystem path a scan container opens, and nothing on
the recon side validated them: no realpath, no commonpath, no basename check
anywhere in the consumers. The MCP deny list WAS the control, and this replaces
it so the column can be opened.

Why it is worse than an ordinary file read: ffuf sends each wordlist LINE as a
URL path and records which ones responded, so a wordlist pointed at a file
inside the scan container gets its contents reflected into the graph and the
scan output. That is exfiltration, not just disclosure.

Two validators, because two shapes of value exist and the dangerous input is
different for each:

  project_file       an absolute path. Must resolve inside an allowed root.
  project_file_name  a BASENAME the scan joins onto a mounted directory
                     (`-t /custom-templates/<x>`). Must carry no separator.

This side is authoritative. The MCP write path rejects the same values outright,
but a row can also be written through the webapp, a project import or a version
restore, so the check that matters is the one at settings load.
