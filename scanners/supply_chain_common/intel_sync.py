"""Population of the supply-chain incident-intel volume (`redamon-sca-intel`).

Fetches the supplychainattack.org incident catalog and normalizes it into three
small lookup files plus a manifest. Mirrors `osv_db_sync.py`: the remote feed is
itself an untrusted supply-chain input, so it is host-pinned, envelope-validated,
byte-capped, every value charset-gated, and the result is mounted read-only
everywhere except here.

Run two ways:
  - the operator command `./redamon.sh sca-intel-sync`
  - the orchestrator's TTL-guarded refresh on the scan-spawn path

stdlib only, so it runs inside the tiny analyzer image with no new deps. In
particular this does NOT import services/knowledge_base/curation/safe_http.py:
that module is absent from the analyzer image and importing it fails at runtime,
not at build time. Its logic (scheme check, host allowlist re-checked on every
redirect hop, hop cap, byte cap) is mirrored below instead.
