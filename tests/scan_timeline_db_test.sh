# Scan Timeline — Postgres integration test (schema + referential actions)
# =============================================================================
# Verifies at the DATABASE level what the Prisma models promise, because the
# Scan Timeline's data-loss guarantees rest on them:
#   - the three tables exist with the expected shape
#   - (project_id, seq) is unique  -> version numbering can't fork
#   - project delete cascades      -> no orphan versions/jobs/schedules, and a
#                                     deleted project's snapshot bytes go away
#   - version delete cascades jobs -> Section 5 delete semantics
#   - schedule delete NULLs jobs   -> run history survives losing its schedule
#
# Requires the stack's postgres container to be up:
#   docker compose up -d postgres
# Usage: tests/scan_timeline_db_test.sh
