# =============================================================================
# The MCP env chain, END TO END, without an SSH host.
# Run:  bash tests/deploy_mcp_env_chain_test.sh
#
# WHY: `MCP_SERVER_ENABLED=true` in the deploy .env has to survive FOUR hops to
# reach the running container, and it silently died at three of them:
#
#   1. deploy.sh default        (set -u would otherwise kill the run)
#   2. build_deploy_env         (writes .deploy.env.staged, scp'd to the host)
#   3. the seed step            (writes $APP_PATH/.env on the host)
#   4. compose `environment:`   (the webapp has NO env_file)
#
# Each hop is a different file, and a break in any one of them produces the
# SAME symptom: the endpoint 404s and nothing says why. Worse for this flag
# specifically, redamon.sh's ensure_auth_secrets APPENDS
# `MCP_SERVER_ENABLED=false` when the key is absent, so an unseeded host does
# not merely default off, it is actively pinned off.
#
# This simulates hops 1-3 for real (sourcing deploy.sh's own functions, running
# its own seed shell code) and asserts hop 4 against docker-compose.yml, so the
# whole chain is proven without touching a server.

# ------------------------------------------------- the structural invariant --
# Everything above pins the keys that exist TODAY. This pins the SHAPE, so the
# next inbound-MCP key someone adds cannot repeat the original bug: a key wired
# into compose and reachable from nowhere. Three rules, each broken at some
# point in this feature's life:
#
#   a) a key compose reads must be seeded into the app .env, or compose
#      interpolates it to empty and the operator's value is silently discarded
#   b) cmd_init and cmd_update must seed the SAME set, or the flag works on a
#      fresh install and vanishes on the next upgrade
#   c) every key deploy.sh DEREFERENCES must have a default, or `set -u` aborts
#      the run on an .env that simply omits it, with an unbound-variable trace
#      instead of a usable message
#
# Scope: the INBOUND server's keys, which compose hands to `webapp` and
# `recon-orchestrator`. The MCP_* keys on `agent` and `kali-sandbox` belong to
# the internal Kali MCP servers -- a different feature, whose values are
# container-to-container URLs rather than operator knobs, and which the deploy
# .env has no business carrying.
#
# Also out of scope for (a): MCP_CLIENT_CIDRS and MCP_EDGE_ALLOW_BEARER, which
# nginx.sh and firewall.sh consume on the host and the app never sees. Seeding
# them into the app .env would imply the container honours them.
