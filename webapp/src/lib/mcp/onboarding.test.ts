/**
 * The Agent Onboarding pack.
 *
 * The tests that matter here are COVERAGE tests, not example renders. A pack
 * that omits a live tool teaches the agent a smaller product than it has, and
 * an agent that never learns `list_findings` exists falls back to the expensive
 * `query_graph` for everything. So the controls are:
 *
 *  - every tool the server advertises has a playbook entry AND sits in exactly
 *    one capability area. Adding a tool without guidance turns this red in the
 *    same commit.
 *  - the scope filter really filters: a read-only token's pack must not describe
 *    a tool it cannot call, and must say plainly that it cannot.
 *  - nothing user-specific ever reaches the output. A SKILL.md travels with a
 *    repository.
 *  - the response-shape facts the prose quotes (the graph states, the section
 *    names, the verdict vocabulary) are pinned against the modules that own
 *    them, because the generator cannot catch those drifting.
 *  - the HAND-WRITTEN prose never promises a protection that does not exist.
 *    This is the one class nothing generated can catch, and it has bitten
 *    twice: the worked scenarios named tools outside the token's scopes, and
 *    the exec guidance claimed a per-command scope check after `kali_exec`
 *    became a real shell. Both guards are phrase-based on purpose - the claim
 *    is prose, so only prose can be asserted about it.
 *  - the documentation the feature added references files that exist, since a
 *    missing screenshot renders as a broken image on the published wiki.
