/**
 * Registry-driven filtering for the recon-settings surface.
 *
 * This replaces a positive allowlist of 126 columns with four dispositions over
 * all 712, and the replacement is the whole point of the work: blocking a field
 * by name was a crude proxy for "this value could be dangerous", and it was
 * wrong in both directions at once.
 *
 *   settable      write any time
 *   create_only   write once at creation; refused afterwards, naming the tool
 *                 that can set it
 *   never         not a pipeline parameter at all; refused with its class
 *
 * There is no one-direction disposition any more. The engagement's limits are
 * ordinary settable fields: what makes them safe is that every one of them is
 * ENFORCED at scan start whatever tuning says, so lowering a ceiling and raising
 * it are equally permitted and equally auditable, which is how the rest of this
 * surface already works. A write-time direction check bought the appearance of
 * that guarantee and not the guarantee: five of the fields it covered accepted a
 * widening while reporting 'tightened'.
 *
 * Fail-closed in every direction, as before: an unknown key rejects the WHOLE
 * call naming the key, and an out-of-range value rejects it naming the bound.
 * Nothing is silently stripped or clamped, because a caller who believes a
 * setting applied when it did not will act on a scan configured differently
 * from the one it asked for.
