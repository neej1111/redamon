"""
Surfaces 2 and 7: every registry runtime key is really wired to a column.

T1 makes the build fail when a Prisma column has no registry entry. T36 makes it
fail when a runtime key has no registry entry. Between them sat the gap this
closes: a column with a registry entry that names a `runtime_key` NOTHING READS.
The field is documented, bounded, validated and settable, and the pipeline never
sees the value.

That failure is invisible from every other angle. `describe_recon_settings`
advertises it, `update_recon_settings` accepts it, `get_recon_settings` echoes it
back, and the scan runs with the shipped default. A caller has no way to tell.

ASSERTED rather than generated, deliberately. Generating the 530-line mapping
block would give the same guarantee and a diff nobody can review; a test that
fails when a registry key has no mapping is the same control at a tenth of the
cost. The shapes are checked too, because `project.get(k) or D` and
`project.get(k, D)` differ on an empty value and the registry records which is
which.
