/**
 * Three precomputed views an agent asks for constantly and that natural
 * language answers badly and expensively: describe the surface, what is
 * exploitable, and which vulnerable technology reaches the most of it.
 *
 * Each is ONE purpose-built query sent through `/graph/exec op:cypher`, which
 * is how it inherits `scope_query`, the row and byte caps, the MCP concurrency
 * ceiling, the explicit timeout and the outbound tenant post-validation, for
 * free and with no change to the agent. The analytics routes behind the UI are
 * deliberately not reused: they authorise with the ACCESS_ENFORCE-aware browser
 * guard, scope on `project_id` alone rather than the full tenant key, run
 * outside every MCP bound, and each issues 7 to 11 separate queries - which
 * over this surface would be 7 to 11 round trips per call against a concurrency
 * ceiling of two.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS ABOUT THE CYPHER BELOW ARE LOAD-BEARING. Each was measured
 * against `graph_db/tenant_filter.py`, and the routes' own queries get three of
 * them wrong:
 *
 *  1. NO inline tenant property, and no `$pid`. The exec request binds exactly
 *     `tenant_user_id` and `tenant_project_id` and has no params field at all,
 *     so a carried-over `{project_id: $pid}` dies on ParameterMissing - and
 *     injection would first turn it into a DUPLICATED KEY in one map literal.
 *     Scoping is the injector's job.
 *  2. GLOBAL-REFERENCE LABELS ARE SPELLED OUT ON EVERY RE-REFERENCE. A pattern
 *     is exempt from tenant injection only when ALL its labels are global
 *     (CVE, MitreData, Capec). A bare re-reference such as
 *     `OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:HAS_CWE]->(m:MitreData)` gets tenant props injected
 *     into `(c)`, and CVE nodes carry no tenant props by design, so it matches
 *     NOTHING. That is not hypothetical: it is why the Red Zone kill-chain view
 *     reports `cisaKev` false for every row and the blast-radius view sorts by
 *     a `kevCount` that is permanently 0. HTTP 200, no error, ranking gone.
 *  3. THE STALE HALF IS WRITTEN BY HAND. `scope_query` injects `!Muted` into
 *     every pattern but never `stale_since IS NULL`, so without the explicit
 *     predicate these tools would count findings a later scan stopped
 *     reporting and disagree with `graph_summary`.
 *  4. NOTHING HERE MAY NAME THE `Muted` LABEL. `scope_query` refuses any query
 *     that so much as mentions it. That is why `notMuted()` from
 *     `@/lib/graphMute` - the helper every browser-side finding query uses - is
 *     deliberately NOT used here: its text contains 'Muted', so it would turn
 *     every one of these into a hard refusal. The exclusion still happens, just
 *     server-side and after this text is written.
 *
 * These views project SCALARS, and the outbound tenant post-validation
 * explicitly cannot check a scalar. So `scope_query` is the sole isolation
 * boundary for them, with nothing behind it: keep each query small enough to
 * read in one sitting.
