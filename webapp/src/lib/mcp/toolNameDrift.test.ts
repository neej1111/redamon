/**
 * P8: no shipped agent-facing string names a tool that is not on the surface.
 *
 * `playbook.ts` is the one that makes this worth a test rather than a habit. It
 * is read by the connected agent AT RUN TIME, so a line still saying "call
 * `tighten_engagement_roe`" does not produce a stale doc, it sends an agent
 * after something that answers "unknown tool" - and an unattended agent's reply
 * to an opaque failure is usually another attempt.
 *
 * The same failure has a quieter form in `onboarding.ts` and `scopeCopy.ts`:
 * those are written into the onboarding pack and the token-permission UI, so a
 * deleted tool named there teaches a person a capability that does not exist.
 *
 * Deliberately crude, and checked against the LIVE `tools/list` rather than a
 * list of names, because a list of names is the thing that goes stale.
