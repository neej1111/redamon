/**
 * What is happening on ONE project right now, for the inbound MCP surface.
 *
 * The question "is anything writing this graph?" already had an answer in
 * `graphWriters.ts`, but only by asking the orchestrator once per scan kind:
 * up to seven sequential round trips. `graph_summary` sits in the 120/min read
 * bucket, so it could not afford that and checked only two of the seven kinds -
 * reporting `stable` (documented as "the counts are trustworthy") while a GVM,
 * GitHub Secret Hunt, TruffleHog, supply-chain or AI attack-surface scan was
 * inserting finding nodes.
 *
 * `GET /system/active-scans` answers all seven in ONE in-memory read, and its
 * active-status set is at least as conservative as every per-kind set the
 * webapp keeps. It is also cross-project, which is the thing to be careful
 * about: it returns every user's scans, so the filter below runs before any of
 * it is returned or counted.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED. A source that cannot be read sets `unknown`, never "nothing is
 * running". The webapp's own Activity view swallows this failure and renders an
 * empty list, which is right for a UI with database fallbacks and wrong here:
 * on this surface it becomes a false negative in a security tool.
